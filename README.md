## How To Use üîß

From your command line, first clone Simplefolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/cobidev/simplefolio

# Go into the repository
$ cd simplefolio

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

Then you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn:

Using NPM:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start development server
$ npm start
```

**NOTE**:
If your run into issues installing the dependencies with NPM, use this command:

```bash
# Install dependencies with all permissions
$ sudo npm install --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:8080/` and you will see the website running on a Development Server:
